a simple and small xml parser and encoder for delphi pascal.  This code provides a simple alternative to the ms-xml based parsers, and is written 100% in delphi pascal.

THIS CODE IS A WORK IN PROGRESS

If you are looking for some xml classes that you can plug into your own program, I would suggest looking elswhere for now.  This code is still in the early stage of development.
